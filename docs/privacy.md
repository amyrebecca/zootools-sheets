# Zoo Tools for Google Sheets Add-on Privacy Policy

We do not store your data. The add-on has no data stores that it uses. This add-on also does not use any intermediaries or 3rd parties that may store your data.

The add-on asks for permission to view and edit your current spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly`

The add-on has a set of scripts that will process spreadsheet data you input and output either statistics or plots for you. This is a convenience for you so that you do not have to learn spreadsheet A1 notation.
