# Zoo Tools for Google Sheets Add-on Privacy Policy

We (the Zooniverse) need to ask for permission for our add-on program to view and edit the current spreadsheet in order for this experience to work; the add-on has a set of scripts that will process spreadsheet data that you input, and output either statistics or plots for you. This makes the whole thing easier, and avoids you having to learn spreadsheet notation.

We want you to know, though, that we do not store your data, and the add-on has no data stores that it uses. It also does not use any intermediaries or 3rd parties who might store your data.

Our add-on works using the Google Sheets API scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly`.
